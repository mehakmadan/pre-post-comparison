# README: TeenTee: Pre-Post Comparison

# Final Project: 
- Work has been done in 2 main files: `Data-clean-final.Rmd` wherein I cleaned up the data, and then imported it in the final qmd to analyse and tranform into a manuscript.

This repository contains the analysis code and supporting data for a research project evaluating the effectiveness of the Teen TEE (Talk, Educate, Experience) program.  The Teen TEE program is a strengths-based initiative aimed at empowering early adolescent Black girls by fostering identity development, belonging, and community building.
