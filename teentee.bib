	abstract = {This paper examines a study to develop a reliable measure of relatedness that utilizes language appropriate for youth, is simple for staff to administer in a field-based setting, and is consistent with the Youth Outcomes Battery. Pilot instruments were distributed to three residential summer camps serving female and male campers between the ages 10-17. The results of this study indicate that the Youth Relatedness Scale is an easy-to-use measure that exhibits good evidence of internal consistency and shows good criterion evidence of validity for this population of youth. This study was a positive step towards providing a theoretically grounded, simple, and versatile measure that captures youth perceptions of relatedness and that youth program administrators can employ to evaluate their programs.},

Consistent with Erikson's and Tajfel's theoretical perspectives, the {EIS} assesses 3 domains of ethnic identity formation: exploration, resolution, and affirmation. In both studies, participants (N = 846) completed measures of familial ethnic socialization and self-esteem in addition to completing the {EIS}. In Study 1, we employed exploratory and confirmatory analyses to examine, refine, and confirm the factor structure of the {EIS} among university students (n = 615). In Study 2, we examined the psychometric properties of the {EIS} among high school students (n = 231). Results revealed a three-factor solution that reflected the proposed components of exploration, resolution, and affirmation. Furthermore, the three subscales were related in expected ways to measures of familial ethnic socialization and self-esteem.},

	abstract = {We present a series of studies on the development and validation of the Self-Compassion Scale-Youth version ({SCS}-Y), which is intended for use with early adolescents in middle school. Study 1 (N = 279, Mage = 12.17) describes the selection of 17 items out of a pool of 36 potential items, with three items each representing the subscales of self-kindness, mindfulness, common humanity, self-judgment, isolation, and two items representing over-identification. Using state-of-the-art psychometric analyses ideal for examining multidimensional constructs like self-compassion-bifactor exploratory structural equation modeling (bifactor-{ESEM})-findings supported the use of a general self-compassion score and six subscale scores. Study 2 cross-validated the factor structure of the {SCS}-Y with a second sample of youths (N = 402, Mage = 12.43). Study 3 found support for the test-retest reliability of the {SCS}-Y (N = 102, Mage = 12.52). Study 4 (N = 212, Mage = 12.18) established construct validity for the {SCS}-Y by demonstrating that {SCS}-Y scores were significantly associated with mindfulness, happiness, life-satisfaction, depression, resilience, and achievement goal orientation in expected directions. Overall, findings suggest that the {SCS}-Y is a reliable and valid measure of self-compassion for use with youths.},

The psychometric properties of the Adolescent Measure of Empathy and Sympathy ({AMES}) were established in two studies. In the first study, among 499 adolescents (10–15 years old), the structure of the {AMES} was investigated and the number of items was reduced. In the second study, among 450 adolescents, test-retest reliability and construct validity of the {AMES} was evaluated. Results indicate that the {AMES} met the standards of reliability and validity. By specifically distinguishing between affective empathy and sympathy, the {AMES} provides a distinct advantage over existing measurement tools and is useful in elucidating the relationship between empathy and behavior in adolescents.

After a brief introduction we present a historical and theoretical overview of civic engagement with regard to children and adolescents and racially marginalized communities. We then introduce the P-{VEST} framework and examine civic engagement as a proactive reactive coping method to counteract the vulnerability and stress of systematic racial injustice. Following a discussion of the current empirical literature we explore the utility of civic engagement programs (e.g., Youth Participatory Action Research) as interventions to support positive development of minority youth. We conclude with policy implications and future directions for research to leverage civic engagement as a coping strategy for the positive development of minority children and their communities.},

The current study assessed whether perceiving a Black child as older increases the odds of mistakenly perceiving anger. Participating were 152 parents who viewed video representations of 40 children in an emotion understanding paradigm. Black children were not seen as older than White children but they did have 1.27 higher odds of being misperceived as angry (p {\textless} .05). Additionally, for each year increase in perceived age, the odds of anger bias increased by 1.04 for the Black children (p {\textless} .05), but did not increase for White children. Implications of this finding include Black children receiving increased consequences when adults perceive them as older and angry.},

Although sex differences in vocational interests have long been observed (Thorndike, 1911), an appropriate overall measure has been lacking from the literature. Using a cross-sectional sample of United States residents aged 14 to 63 who completed the Strong Interest Inventory assessment between 2005 and 2014 (N = 1,283,110), I examined sex, age, ethnicity, and year effects on work related interest levels using both multivariate and univariate effect size estimates of individual dimensions (Holland’s Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional). Men scored higher on Realistic (d = −1.14), Investigative (d = −.32), Enterprising (d = −.22), and Conventional (d = −.23), while women scored higher on Artistic (d = .19) and Social (d = .38), mostly replicating previous univariate findings. Multivariate, overall sex differences were very large (disattenuated Mahalanobis’ D = 1.61; 27\% overlap). Interest levels were slightly lower and overall sex differences larger in younger samples. Overall sex differences have narrowed slightly for 18-22 year-olds in more recent samples. Generally very small ethnicity effects included relatively higher Investigative and Enterprising scores for Asians, Indians, and Middle Easterners, lower Realistic scores for Blacks and Native Americans, higher Realistic, Artistic, and Social scores for Pacific Islanders, and lower Conventional scores for Whites. Using Prediger’s (1982) model, women were more interested in people (d = 1.01) and ideas (d = .18), while men were more interested in things and data. These results, consistent with previous reviews showing large sex differences and small year effects, suggest that large sex differences in work related interests will continue to be observed for decades.
